# Story: 4.3 - MongoDB Connection Management

**Epic:** 4 - Database Connector Implementation
**Status:** Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to implement connection management for MongoDB in the Database Connector service, so that the platform can connect to and interact with this NoSQL database.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The service can establish a connection to a MongoDB database using a provided connection string.
2.  The implementation uses the official MongoDB Java Driver.
3.  Connection details are handled securely.
4.  A custom Spring Boot Health Indicator is created to verify the status of the MongoDB connection.
5.  Unit and integration tests are created to validate the MongoDB connection logic.

## Dev Notes

*   **Architect's Note (2025-08-11):** The original plan to implement `ConnectionService` for MongoDB was flawed as the interface is JDBC-specific. The revised plan is to create a separate `MongoConnectionService` that does not implement this interface and will have its own `connect` method returning a `MongoClient`. The `ConnectionController` will be updated to handle this new service alongside the existing ones.
*   **Frameworks**: Continue using Java and the Spring Boot framework. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
*   **Data Models**: The `DataSource` model will be used to pass connection details. For MongoDB, the `connectionDetails` map should contain a `connectionString`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
*   **File Locations**: All new code should be within the existing `db-connector` service directory.
*   **Coding Standards**: Adhere to the Google Java Style Guide. Use Maven for dependency management. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
*   **Testing Requirements**:
    *   Unit tests should be written using JUnit 5 and Mockito.
    *   Integration tests MUST use TestContainers to spin up an ephemeral MongoDB database to validate the connection. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] Add the MongoDB Java Driver dependency (`org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-sync`) to the `pom.xml`.
*   [x] Add the Testcontainers dependency for MongoDB to the `pom.xml`.
*   [x] Create a new `MongoConnectionService` class (do NOT implement `ConnectionService`).
*   [x] In `MongoConnectionService`, create a `public MongoClient connect(DataSource dataSource)` method that establishes and returns a connection to a MongoDB instance.
*   [x] Update the `ConnectionController` to inject `MongoConnectionService`.
*   [x] In `ConnectionController`'s `testConnection` method, add logic to call `MongoConnectionService.connect()` when the `sourceType` is `MONGODB`.
*   [x] Implement a custom `MongoDbHealthIndicator`.
*   [x] Write unit tests for the `MongoConnectionService`.
*   [x] Write integration tests using Testcontainers that start a MongoDB container and verify that the service can successfully connect to it via the controller.
