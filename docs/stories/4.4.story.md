# Story: 4.4 - Schema Introspection

**Epic:** 4 - Database Connector Implementation
**Status:** Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to implement schema introspection capabilities for connected databases, so that the platform can understand and display the structure of the user's data.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The service can retrieve a list of tables from a connected PostgreSQL database.
2.  The service can retrieve a list of tables from a connected MySQL database.
3.  The service can retrieve a list of collections from a connected MongoDB database.
4.  The service can retrieve the schema (e.g., column names, data types) for a specific table or collection from each of the supported database types.
5.  The retrieved schema information is returned in a standardized format.
6.  Unit and integration tests are created to validate the schema introspection logic.

## Dev Notes

*   **Frameworks**: Continue using Java and the Spring Boot framework. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
*   **Data Models**: A new set of models should be created to represent database schemas in a standardized way (e.g., `TableSchema`, `ColumnSchema`). These models will be used for the API response. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
*   **JDBC Metadata**: For the SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), use the `java.sql.DatabaseMetaData` interface to retrieve schema information. Methods like `getTables()` and `getColumns()` will be useful.
*   **MongoDB Schema**: For MongoDB, you will need to list collections and can inspect a sample of documents to infer a schema, as MongoDB is schema-less. The level of detail for the inferred schema should be discussed if not clear.
*   **File Locations**: All new code should be within the existing `db-connector` service directory.
*   **Testing Requirements**: Integration tests are critical for this story. They must use Testcontainers to create tables/collections with specific schemas and then verify that the introspection logic returns the correct, standardized structure. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] Define and create new Java classes for the standardized schema representation (e.g., `TableSchema`, `ColumnSchema`) in the `model` package.
*   [x] Create a new `SchemaService` responsible for handling schema introspection logic.
*   [x] Implement a method in `SchemaService` to list tables/collections for a given `DataSource`.
*   [x] Implement a method in `SchemaService` to get the detailed schema for a specific table/collection.
*   [x] Create a new `SchemaController` to expose endpoints for listing tables/collections and getting schema details.
*   [x] Write unit tests for the `SchemaService`, mocking the underlying database metadata calls.
*   [x] Write integration tests using Testcontainers. The tests should:
    *   Create tables/collections in the test containers.
    *   Populate them with sample data.
    *   Call the new API endpoints and assert that the returned schema matches the structure created in the test.
