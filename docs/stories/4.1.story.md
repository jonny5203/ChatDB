# Story: 4.1 - Basic Service Scaffolding

**Epic:** 4 - Database Connector Implementation
**Status:** Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to create the basic project structure for the Database Connector service, so that I have a foundation for future development of database connectivity features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new directory for the Database Connector service is created.
2.  The service is initialized as a Java Spring Boot project.
3.  A basic `/health` endpoint is created that returns a 200 OK status to verify the service is running.
4.  A Dockerfile is created to containerize the service.

## Dev Notes

*   **Frameworks**: The service should be built using Java and the Spring Boot framework. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
*   **File Locations**: The new service should be created in a new directory named `db-connector`. [Source: No specific guidance found in unified-project-structure.md, which was not available, but this follows the pattern of other services.]
*   **Coding Standards**: All Java code should adhere to the Google Java Style Guide. Use Maven or Gradle for dependency management. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
*   **Testing Requirements**: A basic unit test should be created to verify the health check endpoint returns the correct status. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] Create a new directory named `db-connector`.
*   [x] Initialize a new Spring Boot project within the `db-connector` directory using the Spring Initializr (or your preferred method), ensuring it includes the `Spring Web` dependency.
*   [x] Create a new REST controller for the health check.
*   [x] Implement a `/health` GET endpoint that returns an HTTP 200 OK response.
*   [x] Create a basic unit test for the health check endpoint.
*   [x] Create a `Dockerfile` in the `db-connector` directory to build and run the Spring Boot application.

## Dev Agent Record

_This section is to be populated by the Dev Agent during implementation._

### Agent Model Used

Gemini

### Debug Log References

*   Spring Initializr download failed due to invalid Spring Boot version.
*   Corrected version and successfully initialized project.
*   `mvn test` failed due to incorrect working directory.
*   Corrected `mvn` command to run from root with `-f` flag.

### Completion Notes List

*   Initialized a new Spring Boot (Maven) project in `db-connector/`.
*   Added a `HealthController.java` with a `/health` endpoint.
*   Added a `HealthControllerTest.java` to validate the endpoint.
*   Created a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for containerizing the service.
*   All tests passed successfully.

### File List

*   `db-connector/` (created)
*   `db-connector/pom.xml` (created)
*   `db-connector/src/main/java/com/chatdb/dbconnector/DbConnectorApplication.java` (created)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-11

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent. The developer correctly followed the story requirements to bootstrap a standard Spring Boot service. The code is clean, the tests are appropriate for this scaffolding story, and the Dockerfile uses best practices (multi-stage build).

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary as the implementation was correct and followed established patterns.
