title: "Story 7.3: Real-time Prediction Endpoint"
---

### Status
- Done

### Story
**As a** platform engineer,
**I want** to implement a real-time prediction endpoint in the Prediction Service,
**so that** we can serve predictions from loaded models.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The Prediction Service has a `/predict` endpoint that accepts a model name and input data.
2. The endpoint loads the specified model (if not already cached).
3. The endpoint uses the loaded model to make a prediction based on the input data.
4. The endpoint returns the prediction result in the response.
5. The prediction logic is separate from the endpoint handler.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create a new `predictor.go` file to encapsulate the prediction logic.
- [x] Implement a `Predict` function in `predictor.go` that takes a model and input data, and returns a prediction.
- [x] Update the `/predict` endpoint handler in `main.go` to use the `Predict` function.
- [x] Add unit tests for the `Predict` function.
- [x] Update the unit tests for the `/predict` endpoint handler.

### Dev Notes
- The prediction logic will depend on the model type. For now, we can simulate the prediction logic.
- The `Predict` function should be designed to be extensible for different model types.

### Testing
- Unit tests should be written using the standard `go test` command.
- Tests should cover the `Predict` function and the `/predict` endpoint handler.
- Mocking should be used for the model loading and prediction logic.
