# Story: 2.1 - Basic Service Scaffolding

**Epic:** 2 - Query Parser Implementation
**Status:** Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to create the basic project structure for the Query Parser service, so that I have a foundation for future development.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new directory for the Query Parser service is created.
2.  The service is initialized as a Python project.
3.  A basic "hello world" endpoint is created to verify the service is running.

## Dev Notes

*   **Project Structure:** The Query Parser service should be created in a new directory named `query-parser`. [Source: architecture/1-high-level-architecture.md#Repository Structure]
*   **Language:** The service will be written in Python. [Source: architecture/1-high-level-architecture.md#Technical Summary]
*   **Framework:** Use a popular Python web framework like Flask or FastAPI. [Source: Not explicitly in architecture, but a standard practice for Python services.]

## Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] Create a new directory named `query-parser`.
*   [x] Initialize a new Python project in the `query-parser` directory.
*   [x] Create a `main.py` file with a basic HTTP server.
*   [x] Implement a `/health` endpoint that returns a 200 OK status.
*   [x] Create a `Dockerfile` for the service.
*   [x] Create a Kubernetes deployment and service manifest for the Query Parser.
