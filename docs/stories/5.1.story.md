# Story: 5.1 - Basic Service Scaffolding

**Epic:** 5 - Model Registry Implementation
**Status:** Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to create the basic project structure for the Model Registry service, so that I have a foundation for future development of model management features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new directory for the Model Registry service is created.
2.  The service is initialized as a Python FastAPI project.
3.  A basic `/health` endpoint is created that returns a 200 OK status to verify the service is running.
4.  A Dockerfile is created to containerize the service.

## Dev Notes

*   **Frameworks**: The service should be built using Python and the FastAPI framework. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
*   **File Locations**: The new service should be created in a new directory named `model-registry`.
*   **Coding Standards**: All Python code should adhere to the `black` formatting style and be linted with `flake8`. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
*   **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests should be written using the `pytest` framework. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] Create a new directory named `model-registry`.
*   [x] Initialize a new Python project within the `model-registry` directory, preferably using `poetry` or `pip` with a `requirements.txt` file.
*   [x] Add `fastapi` and `uvicorn` as dependencies.
*   [x] Create a `main.py` file with a basic FastAPI application.
*   [x] Implement a `/health` GET endpoint that returns `{"status": "ok"}`.
*   [x] Create a `Dockerfile` in the `model-registry` directory to build and run the FastAPI application.
*   [x] Create a basic unit test to verify the `/health` endpoint returns a 200 status code and the correct JSON response.

## Dev Agent Record

_This section is to be populated by the Dev Agent during implementation._

### Agent Model Used

Gemini

### Debug Log References

*   `venv` was not available in the user's Python environment.
*   Switched to using `pipenv` as requested by the user.
*   Test execution failed due to missing `httpx` dependency.
*   Test execution failed due to `ModuleNotFoundError`.

### Completion Notes List

*   Created a new FastAPI service in the `model-registry` directory.
*   Initialized a `pipenv` environment and installed dependencies.
*   Created a `/health` endpoint and a unit test for it.
*   Added a `Dockerfile` for containerization.

### File List

*   `model-registry/` (created)
*   `model-registry/Pipfile` (created)
*   `model-registry/Pipfile.lock` (created)
*   `model-registry/main.py` (created)
*   `model-registry/Dockerfile` (created)
*   `model-registry/tests/test_main.py` (created)
