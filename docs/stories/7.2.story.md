title: "Story 7.2: Dynamic Model Loading"
---

### Status
- Done

### Story
**As a** platform engineer,
**I want** to implement dynamic model loading in the Prediction Service,
**so that** we can serve predictions for different models without restarting the service.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The Prediction Service can load a model from the Model Registry.
2. The Prediction Service can cache loaded models in memory.
3. The Prediction Service can unload a model from memory to free up resources.
4. The model loading is triggered by a request to the prediction endpoint.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement a client to communicate with the Model Registry service.
- [ ] Implement a model cache to store loaded models.
- [ ] Implement the logic to load a model from the Model Registry if it's not in the cache.
- [ ] Implement a mechanism to unload models from the cache (e.g., LRU cache).
- [ ] Add unit tests for the dynamic model loading logic.

### Dev Notes
- The Prediction Service will communicate with the Model Registry service via REST API.
- The model cache can be implemented using a simple in-memory map or a more sophisticated caching library.
- The model unloading mechanism should be designed to prevent memory leaks.

### Testing
- Unit tests should be written using the standard `go test` command.
- Tests should cover the model loading, caching, and unloading logic.
- Mocking should be used for the Model Registry service.
