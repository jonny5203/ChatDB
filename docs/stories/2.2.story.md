# Story: 2.2 - Standard SQL Parsing

**Epic:** 2 - Query Parser Implementation
**Status:** Ready for Review

## Story

As a developer, I want to implement standard SQL parsing in the Query Parser service, so that I can understand and validate SQL queries.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The Query Parser service can receive a SQL query as input.
2.  The Query Parser service can parse the SQL query and return an abstract syntax tree (AST).
3.  The Query Parser service returns an error if the SQL query is invalid.

## Dev Notes

*   **SQL Parsing Library:** Use a Python library like `sqlparse` to parse the SQL queries. [Source: Not explicitly in architecture, but a standard practice for Python services.]

## Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] Add the `sqlparse` library to the `Pipfile`.
*   [x] Create a new route in `main.py` that accepts a SQL query as input.
*   [x] Implement the SQL parsing logic in the new route.
*   [x] Write a unit test to verify that the SQL parsing is working correctly.
