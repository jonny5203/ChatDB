title: "Story 6.4: CPU Resource Management"
---

### Status
- Done

### Story
**As a** platform engineer,
**I want** to implement CPU resource management in the Training Orchestrator service,
**so that** we can control the resource allocation for training jobs.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The Training Orchestrator can limit the number of concurrent training jobs.
2. The Training Orchestrator can specify the CPU resources for each training job.
3. The Training Orchestrator will queue jobs if the maximum number of concurrent jobs is reached.
4. The CPU resource limits are configurable.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement a mechanism to limit the number of concurrent training jobs.
- [x] Add a new field to the `TrainingJob` model to specify the CPU resource request.
- [x] Update the training workflow to consider the CPU resource limits.
- [x] Add configuration options for the maximum number of concurrent jobs and the default CPU resource request.
- [x] Add unit tests for the CPU resource management logic.

### Dev Notes
- The CPU resource management will be implemented in the Training Orchestrator service.
- The number of concurrent jobs can be controlled using a semaphore or a similar mechanism.
- The CPU resource request will be passed to the ML Engine service when starting a training job.

### Testing
- Unit tests should be written using `pytest`.
- Tests should cover the CPU resource management logic.
- Mocking should be used for the ML Engine service.
