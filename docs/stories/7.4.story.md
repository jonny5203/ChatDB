title: "Story 7.4: Performance Monitoring"
---

### Status
- Done

### Story
**As a** platform engineer,
**I want** to implement performance monitoring in the Prediction Service,
**so that** we can track prediction latency and resource usage.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The Prediction Service exposes Prometheus metrics for prediction latency and resource usage.
2. A Grafana dashboard is created to visualize the performance metrics.
3. The performance monitoring is enabled by a feature flag.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add a Prometheus client library to the Prediction Service.
- [x] Instrument the `Predict` function to record prediction latency.
- [x] Add metrics for CPU and memory usage.
- [x] Create a Grafana dashboard to visualize the metrics.
- [x] Add a feature flag to enable/disable performance monitoring.

### Dev Notes
- The Prometheus metrics should be exposed on a separate `/metrics` endpoint.
- The Grafana dashboard should be provisioned automatically.

### Testing
- Unit tests should be written for the new metrics.
- Integration tests should be written to verify that the metrics are exposed correctly.
