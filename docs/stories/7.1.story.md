title: "Story 7.1: Basic Service Scaffolding"
---

### Status
- Done

### Story
**As a** platform engineer,
**I want** to create the basic scaffolding for the Prediction Service,
**so that** we have a foundation for building the model loading and real-time inference features.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. A new microservice named `prediction-service` is created with a basic Go project structure.
2. The service includes a Dockerfile for containerization.
3. The service has a basic health check endpoint.
4. The service is integrated into the existing monorepo structure.
5. The service has a basic README.md file with setup and run instructions.
6. The service has a `go.mod` file for dependency management.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create a new directory `prediction-service` in the root of the monorepo.
- [x] Initialize a new Go project with `go mod init`.
- [x] Create a `main.go` file with a basic HTTP server.
- [x] Add a `/health` endpoint to the HTTP server.
- [x] Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the service.
- [x] Create a `README.md` file.
- [x] Add the new service to the monorepo configuration.

### Dev Notes
- The Prediction Service will be implemented in Go.
- The service should follow the existing patterns for other Go services in the monorepo (e.g., `api-gateway`).

### Testing
- Unit tests should be written using the standard `go test` command.
- Test files should be named with the `_test.go` suffix.
- A basic test for the `/health` endpoint should be created.
