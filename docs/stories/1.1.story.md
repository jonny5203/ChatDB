# Story: 1.1 - Basic Service Scaffolding

**Epic:** 1 - API Gateway Implementation
**Status:** Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to create the basic project structure for the API Gateway service, so that I have a foundation for future development.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new directory for the API Gateway service is created.
2.  The service is initialized as a Go project.
3.  A basic "hello world" endpoint is created to verify the service is running.

## Dev Notes

*   **Project Structure:** The API Gateway service should be created in a new directory named `api-gateway`. [Source: architecture/1-high-level-architecture.md#Repository Structure]
*   **Language:** The service will be written in Go. [Source: architecture/1-high-level-architecture.md#Technical Summary]
*   **Platform:** The service will be containerized and orchestrated on Kubernetes. [Source: architecture/1-high-level-architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]

## Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] Create a new directory named `api-gateway`.
*   [x] Initialize a new Go module in the `api-gateway` directory.
*   [x] Create a `main.go` file with a basic HTTP server.
*   [x] Implement a `/health` endpoint that returns a 200 OK status.
*   [x] Create a `Dockerfile` for the service.
*   [x] Create a Kubernetes deployment and service manifest for the API Gateway.
