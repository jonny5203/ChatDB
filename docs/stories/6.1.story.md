title: "Story 6.1: Training Orchestrator Scaffolding"
---

### Status
- Done

### Story
**As a** platform engineer,
**I want** to create the basic scaffolding for the Training Orchestrator service,
**so that** we have a foundation for building the training job queuing and orchestration features.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. A new microservice named `training-orchestrator` is created with a basic Python project structure.
2. The service includes a Dockerfile for containerization.
3. The service has a basic health check endpoint.
4. The service is integrated into the existing monorepo structure.
5. The service has a basic README.md file with setup and run instructions.
6. The service has a `Pipfile` for dependency management.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create a new directory `training-orchestrator` in the root of the monorepo.
- [x] Initialize a new Python project with a `Pipfile`.
- [x] Create a `main.py` file with a basic FastAPI application.
- [x] Add a `/health` endpoint to the FastAPI application.
- [x] Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the service.
- [x] Create a `README.md` file.
- [x] Add the new service to the monorepo configuration.

### Dev Notes
- The Training Orchestrator service will be implemented in Python using FastAPI.
- The service should follow the existing patterns for other Python services in the monorepo.
- Refer to the `ml_engine` or `query-parser` services for examples of project structure and Dockerfile.

### Testing
- Unit tests should be written using `pytest`.
- Test files should be placed in a `tests/` directory.
- A basic test for the `/health` endpoint should be created.
